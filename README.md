# PDL Challenge

Thank you for taking the time to complete this assignment. We believe this to be an effective way to showcase your skills, on your own time, without the pressure of someone looking over your shoulder. Your code will help us decide if we'd like to proceed with the interview process. Please understand that completing this assignment doesn't guarantee follow up interviews. We will keep you posted either way.

_Even though there is no strict time limit, it should take you ~4 hours to complete the assignment. Have fun!_

The instructions are outlined in the [PDL Data Engineering Challenge.pdf](.PDL Data Engineering Challenge.pdf)
