# Package a Process
Objective: Snap a simple piece of software. 

Please snap (https://snapcraft.io/) one of the following options:

1. A small python app that uses the numpy module in some way.
2. A piece of existing software that hasn't been snapped yet.


Send the github project url for the snap and the url to the snap in the snap store to <james@peopledatalabs.com> when you are done.

Please let <james@peopledatalabs.com> know if you have any questions.

Thank you, and good luck!
